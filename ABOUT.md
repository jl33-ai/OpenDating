OpenDating makes all account data available, and uses an open-source and collaborative algorithm for matchmaking. We believe that relationships online should be completely transparent and secure.

Our goal is to build the Google Search of dating, and we think that we can get there through open-source collaboration. 

We are looking for contributors to help us build the best romantic matchmaking algorithm in the world.
