**OpenDating** is an open-source dating app, available via a [simple API]().

- See all your account data
- How your account is being interacted with
- How matchmaking occurs

This repository contains:
- The [OpenDating]() REST specification
- The [algorithm](https://github.com/jl33-ai/OpenDating/blob/main/src/matchmaker.ts) used to generate recommended profiles.

We believe that forming relationships online should be completely transparent.
