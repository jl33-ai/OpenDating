**OpenDating** is an open-source matchmaking engine, available via a [simple API]().

We believe that forming relationships online should be an act of high transparency.

OpenDating allows you to see:
- All your account data
- How your account is being interacted with
- How matchmaking occurs

This repository contains:
- The [OpenDating]() REST specification
- The [algorithm](https://github.com/jl33-ai/OpenDating/blob/main/src/matchmaker.ts) used to generate recommended profiles.
